 * loop from 0 to one less than array.length to look at
 * the next item and push it to the frequency array.  You'll end
 * up with something like [ 0 1 2 4 2 3 1] for an array [0, 1, 
 * 3, 4, 3, 4, 2, 4, 5, 4, 5, 6, 1, 2].  Output should be (with 
 * line breaks) something like: 0:0 1:1 2:2 3:2 4:4)
